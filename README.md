# AUTOSAR-SOFTWARE-DEMO
AUTOSAR Software Demo

üî¥AUTOSAR stands for AUTomotive Open System ARchitecture.

üî¥It has implemented a layered architecture similar to the OSI model with standard specifications founded by a group of companies like BMW Group, Bosch, Continental, Daimler Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Groupe PSA, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Volkswagen Group. (core members of the AUTOSAR).

VECTOR Informatik Is Premium Partner Plus (PP+) at AUTOSAR.

üî¥AUTOSAR aims to standardize the software development of the ECUs used in automotive applications.
üî¥It has different layers to handle and abstract different operations of code.

An AUTOSAR architecture consists of the following layers-

üîµApplication Layer: This layer has the application code which resides on top. It can have different application blocks called Software Components(SWCs) for each feature that the ECU needs to support according to the application.
Example:- Power Window Operation, etc.

üîµAUTOSAR RTE: This layer acts as an intermediary between the Application Layer and the BSW Layer, providing communication and coordination between the SWCs and the BSW components. The RTE manages the interactions between SWCs and BSW components, such as inter-ECU communication, event handling, and resource allocation.

üîµServices Layer: This layer provides different services for applications to use. Services like: System Services, Memory Services, Crypto Services, Off-board communication services, and Communication Services.

üîµECU Abstraction Layer: This layer provides ECU-related abstractions. It contains different abstracted layers like the I/O Hardware Abstraction layer, Onboard device abstraction, Memory hardware Abstraction, Crypto hardware abstraction, etc. to make applications hardware independent.

üîµMCAL: This is Micro Controller Abstraction Layer it has drivers using which the above layers communicate with Microcontroller hardware peripherals.
Example:- GPIO, I/O, A/D functions, etc.

‚è∫Types OF AUTOSAR
There are two types of AUTOSAR architectures named Classic and Adaptive. The classic has all the modules generally needed for an application whereas the Adaptive can be configured and adapted according to the application by removing unnecessary modules.

‚è∫How To Create AUTOSAR Project
For creating an AUTOSAR project you will need software like DaVinci Configurator and developer from Vector. These software generate code based on AUTOSAR framework for your selected hardware, you cannot generate code directly without these software as we do in normal Embedded systems program by using IDE.

Intro
An educational tool for AUTOSAR to help junior embedded enigneers with learning AUTOSAR
AUTOSAR Studio Project is written with Web Technologies (HTML,CSS,JavaScript) and also electron framework to make it as Desktop Application
The aim of the software is to Design Software Components Model and Change it to ARXML files (SWCs.ARXML ,DataTypeAndInterface.ARXML)

AUTOSAR Studio will try to extract the following information:

Software Components Standard Tags (AUTOSAR Release 4.3.0)
Composition DataTypeAndInterface Tags (AUTOSAR Release 4.3.0)
Setup
Clone this repository on your machine.

git clone https://github.com/MinaMourice/AsuSAR-Stack-19.git
Open your terminal and navigate to the repo's directory.

cd AsuSAR-Stack-19/AsuSAR-Stack-19
Run electron installation command:

npm install --save-dev electron
Run start command to run the application:

npm start
Knowledge
What is AUTOSAR ?

AUTOSAR ‚Äì AUTomotive Open Systems ARchitecture Middleware and system-level standard, jointly developed by automobile manufacturers, electronics and software suppliers and tool vendors.
It pursues the objective of creating and establishing an open and standardized software architecture for automotive electronic control units
‚Äúcooperate on standards, compete on implementations‚Äù
What is the software component (SWC)?

The software component is a piece of code that carries out an application or part of an application. In AUTOSAR, software components are not limited to the application layer, i.e. they also exist in the RTE and BSW layer.
The AUTOSAR Software Components encapsulate an application which runs on the AUTOSAR infrastructure.
What is the basic structure of SWC?

Software Component Description
Ports
P-Ports: Provide Ports
R-Ports: Require Ports
PR-Ports: Provide Require Ports
Internal Behavior
Runnables
Events
Implementation.
What are the ports‚Äô interfaces?

Client-Server: The server provides services while one or more clients may use its services to carry out tasks when the operation invoked on a server uses arguments supplied by a client to perform the requested task.
Sender-Receiver: this way of communicating allows one receiver to get information from multiple senders or a sender to send information to an arbitrary number of receivers.
What is the runnable?

A runnable entity is the smallest code fragment inside a SWC. It is these Runnables that are mapped to OS tasks and will execute the behavior of the SWC.
What is ARXML?

ARXML files are a type of files used across AUTOSAR, to author and configure the AUTOSAR software.
ARXML stands for AUTOSAR XML, which is nothing but a schema with certain parameters, this schema is provided by AUTOSAR to standardize the process & increase portability.
